# Google-Line-Chart-With-Angular.JS
This project is an application that uses Google Line Chart and Angular.JS. The goal of this Angular.JS application is to take JSON from reporting API and render it in a Google Line Chart. The JSON has four metrics to show the data.

I have created 4 modules, 4 controllers, 4 views for exactly one for each of the line chart (mertic). A drop down button is placed to switch from one line chart to another. Creating modules, controllers and views differently made it easy for developing the application.

This application is worked on a Angular-seed from the GitHub. I would appreciate their work.
